# Java-Airline-Flight-Project

I developed this interface project in Java. It allows the user to enter all of their information for each flight, it can handle multiple flights. The user inputs: the name of the airlines, a flight number, a departure city, a departure day, a departure time, an arrival city, an arrival day, an arrival time, and the airfare for each flight. After each flight information is inputted, they click "Create a flight" and it gets added to the flight panel. Then they can decide to enter in information about more flights if they wish. On the flight selection tab it shows them all of the flights they have entered in so far. It will only total up all of the flights that have their check boxes checked. For example, if two flights are entered in and both of their check boxes are checked, then it totals up the price of both flights for the user.
